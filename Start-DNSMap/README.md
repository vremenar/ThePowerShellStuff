# Start-DNSMap.ps1
This script will test if DNS records exist. Edit the script to enter the domain you wish to test and if you need dumps of the test in a file. 

# DNS.txt
This file contains most used DNS records. It should be in the same location as the script, or you can edit the script to use your own DNS list to test.
